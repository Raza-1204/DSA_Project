# DSA_Project 
Deliverable 1: Project Proposal & Conceptual Design
Objective:
The goal of this project is to create an online ordering system (eCommerce platform) where customers can browse and purchase products, and the system will process and track their orders. This project will focus on key data structures and algorithms to manage the products, orders, and transactions in an efficient and scalable way.

1. Project Title & Problem Statement
Project Title:
Online Ordering System (eCommerce Platform)
Problem Statement:
The rise of online shopping has created a need for efficient and user-friendly systems that allow customers to browse, select, and purchase products online. This project aims to solve the challenges of managing an online store by creating a system that:
•	Displays products to customers.
•	Allows customers to add products to their cart and checkout.
•	Processes orders, manages inventory, and tracks transaction details.
•	Generates invoices and handles customer interactions with a simple and effective UI.
The system must handle multiple customers and their orders, process payments, and ensure product availability. The key challenges include:
•	Efficiently storing and retrieving product details.
•	Managing customer orders and transaction history.
•	Updating inventory levels after purchases.

2. Data Structures Selection
The system will require several data structures to manage and organize the data efficiently. The key data structures selected for this project are:
1.	Arrays/Lists:
Used to store a collection of products, shopping cart items, and customer orders.
Helps in sequential access and modification, e.g., adding items to a cart or viewing order history.
2.	Hashmaps (Dictionaries):
Used to store product details (product ID, name, price, quantity, etc.), customer details, and order details.
Allows for fast retrieval of products based on their ID or SKU, and quick lookups for customer information.
3.	Queues:
Used to manage the sequence of customer orders in the system.
Each order will be processed in a FIFO manner (First-In-First-Out), ensuring that the first order placed is processed first.
4.	Stacks:
Used to implement the undo functionality, where customers can undo the last item they added to the shopping cart or the last action they performed during the checkout process.
5.	Linked Lists:
Can be used to store transaction history (order details) for each customer or store the details of orders in progress.
Linked lists offer dynamic memory allocation, which allows efficient insertion and deletion of transactions.

3. Algorithmic Approach
The following algorithms will be employed to ensure smooth functionality of the system:
1.	Product Search Algorithm (Hashmap-based):
Products will be stored in a hashmap, with the product ID as the key. This allows fast O(1) time complexity for searching and retrieving product information, such as price, description, and stock status.
2.	Order Processing Algorithm (Queue-based):
When a customer places an order, it will be added to a queue. The order processing will proceed in a FIFO manner, ensuring that each order is processed sequentially.
The system will check if there is enough stock for each item in the order. If yes, it will reserve the stock; if not, it will notify the customer about the item being out of stock.
3.	Shopping Cart Management (Array/List-based):
Customers can add or remove products from their cart. The cart will be represented by a simple array or list, where the customer can add items in real time.
We will implement the undo functionality using a stack, so the customer can remove the last added item easily.
4.	Inventory Update Algorithm:
When an order is placed, the system will update the inventory. Each time a product is purchased, the system will check the quantity in stock and reduce it by the amount bought. This ensures that inventory levels are always up to date.
5.	Invoice Generation Algorithm:
After the order is processed, the system will calculate the total price of the items in the cart, including any discounts or taxes. It will then generate an invoice, which includes the itemized list of products, total amount, and transaction ID.

4. Input & Output Design
Input Design:
•	Product Details: Information like product name, ID, description, price, and available quantity will be input by the admin and stored in the system (hashmap or array).
•	Customer Actions: Customers interact with the system by: 
•	Searching for products.
•	Adding items to the shopping cart.
•	Proceeding to checkout with the chosen products.
•	Entering payment details (simulated for this project).
•	Reviewing and confirming the order.
•	Order Details: After a customer confirms their order, the system will capture order details such as the products purchased, quantity, total cost, and shipping address.
Output Design:
•	Product Display: A list of products will be displayed to customers with their details (name, price, description).
•	Shopping Cart: A dynamic display of items added to the cart, including quantity, price, and total.
•	Order Summary: A final summary showing the customer’s order (items purchased, total cost, shipping, etc.).
•	Invoice: After a successful order, the system will generate an invoice that contains: 
•	Customer details.
•	Product details (name, quantity, price).
•	Total cost.
•	Transaction ID.
•	Payment status (simulated).

5. Course Concepts Application
This project integrates key concepts learned in the course, such as:
•	Data Structures:
•	Hashmaps: Used to efficiently store and retrieve product and customer details.
•	Arrays/Lists: Used to represent the shopping cart and manage the list of products.
•	Queues: Used to manage the processing of orders in a sequential manner.
•	Stacks: Implement the "undo" functionality in the shopping cart.
•	Linked Lists: Used for transaction history and order processing.
•	Algorithms:
•	Search Algorithm: Efficient searching of products in the store using hashmaps.
•	Queue Algorithm: Managing the sequence of customer orders in FIFO order for transaction processing.
•	Inventory Update Algorithm: Ensuring the inventory is correctly updated after each purchase.
•	Problem Solving:
The project will help in solving real-world problems related to online shopping and order management. The system will handle product displays, customer transactions, and inventory updates efficiently.
•	Real-World Application:
The project mimics the real-world eCommerce systems, where order management, inventory handling, and invoice generation are key components of the system.
Conclusion
This Online Ordering System is a comprehensive project that integrates multiple data structures and algorithms to create an efficient, functional eCommerce platform. It combines concepts from arrays, hashmaps, queues, stacks, and linked lists to solve real-world problems in online shopping, providing customers with an easy-to-use platform to manage orders and transactions.
